## Overview

The DTCG 2025.10 spec defines the standard format for design tokens. Use this checklist to ensure your tokens are compliant when migrating to Dispersa.

## Token Format

- [ ] All token properties use $ prefix ($type, $value, $description)
- [ ] All tokens have $type set (directly or inherited from parent group)
- [ ] Color values use the DTCG color object format (colorSpace + components), not hex strings
- [ ] Dimension values use the DTCG dimension object format (value + unit), not strings like "16px"
- [ ] Duration values use the DTCG duration object format (value + unit)
- [ ] Font family is a string or array of strings
- [ ] Font weight is a number (100-900) or valid named string
- [ ] Composite types (shadow, typography, border) use the correct nested structure

## References

- [ ] Alias references use `{'{'}token.path{'}'}` syntax (not `{'{'}token.path.value{'}'}` or `${'${'}...{'}'}`)
- [ ] JSON Pointer references use $ref with # prefix
- [ ] No circular reference chains

## Resolver

- [ ] Resolver document has version: '2025.10'
- [ ] Sets have sources arrays with $ref to token files
- [ ] Modifiers have contexts mapping names to token sources
- [ ] resolutionOrder defines the merge sequence

## Groups

- [ ] Group names do not start with $ (reserved for spec properties)
- [ ] Group-level $type is inherited by all child tokens

## Common Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Hex color strings | Convert to DTCG color object with colorSpace and components |
| String dimensions like "16px" | Convert to DTCG dimension object with value and unit |
| Missing $type | Add $type to each token or use group-level inheritance |
| Reference includes .value | Remove .value suffix from alias references |

## Validation During Migration

Dispersa's validation modes can help you catch issues. Set `validation.mode` to `'warn'` during migration to see all issues without failing the build:

```typescript
const dispersa = new Dispersa({
  resolver: './tokens.resolver.json',
  validation: { mode: 'warn' },
})
```
